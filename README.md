# Getting Started with Create React App

Please run

- npm i / npm install
- json-server src/mocks/json/mock.json --port <YOUR_PORT>

Summary of design:

Used a standard react pattern to organize each file in different folders like Services, Utils, Mocks. etc. 
Also, applied some other patterns/techniques like Singleton for my classes, BEM pattern to manage my scss files.

TODO:

- Some requirements were not completed at all ðŸ˜”, but test was great! :)
